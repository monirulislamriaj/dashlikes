          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To highlight nature and landscapes, use Valencia and Clarendon
            </li>
            <li>For photos of food and ingredients, try Juno and Lo-Fi</li>
            <li>Use Rise or Mayfair for selfies and fashion shots</li>
            <li>Rise and Valencia are best for group shots and pets</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With 25 Instagram filter options to choose from, it can be
            challenging to select the right one. Clarendon is used 25% of the
            time that a filter is applied, making it the
            <a href="#">most popular Instagram filter. </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            However, just because Clarendon works for an image of the beach,
            doesn’t mean it translates for all of your photos. You could
            experiment with various filters, but if you’re running a business
            account then this might not be the best use of your time. At
            FluidBuzz we’ve done the research so you don’t have to.

                Highlight nature and landscapes on your Instagram account with
                Valencia and Clarendon
              </h4>
              <p>
                Whether you’re sharing snow-covered branches in your front yard
                or the view from your beachside hotel room, the right Instagram
                filter will make your posts pop. The preferred filters for
                landscape, nature, scenic views, and travel shots are Clarendon
                and Valencia.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Clarendon filter can be used for content featuring beaches,
                flowers, waterfalls, forests, lakes, mountains, and more. It
                also brightens up blues and greens in any landscape. You can
                apply Clarendon for a great glow, share your post, and get back
                to work.
                <br /><br />
                Capture the true beauty of a wild, wide landscape or field of
                flowers with the Valencia filter. This filter is behind the
                Instagram posts with the most likes lately. Valencia can
                transform even the most subtle shades into potent colors while
                warming up the entire image.

          <h4>Spice up your food photos with Juno and Kelvin</h4>
          <p>
            Whether you’re trying to display the ingredients of your favorite
            breakfast smoothie or the foam on your steamy cappuccino, Juno and
            Kelvin are the filters you want. Juno brightens reds and other warm
            colors for more intense oranges and vibrant yellows. It also gives
            photos a professional feel for more high-quality content.
          </p>
          <p>
            By enhancing shadows and upping the saturation, Lo-Fi makes
            everything in your cafe, restaurant, or kitchen table look more
            enticing, from the meal to the menu board. Pair Lo-Fi with a
            vignette to emphasize the food on the plate, and ensure that the
            actual plate or place setting doesn’t distract from your delicious
            post.

          <h4>
            Get flawless selfies and fashion content with Rise or Mayfair
          </h4>
          <p>
            Have you met Mayfair?
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s the filter that can reduce the appearance of blemishes or
            wrinkles in your selfie, applying delicate vignetting around the
            corners to focus on the image’s center. Use the Mayfair filter on
            photos that are underexposed or brightly lit to infuse images with
            warmth.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whether you are posting a picture of an influencer modeling your
            company’s handbag or just creating a flat lay, the Rise filter
            yields optimal results. Rise helps to minimize skin blemishes and
            wrinkles on the model or in stylish clothing.
